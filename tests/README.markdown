This directory contains scripts that test various aspects of Eff:

- Folders `valid` and `invalid` contain basic regression tests, which ensure that
  inferred types and computed values are what we expect. Any time a bug is
  found, one should add a new test that covers it. Folder `valid` contains programs
  that terminate successfuly, while the ones in `invalid` must terminate with an error.

- The folder `code-generation` contains regression tests that track the ML code
  generated by Eff, and benchmarks that compare the speed of generated code to
  code one would write in ML.

To add new test case to existing test folders:

- Create test file `text_xyz.eff` and reference file `text_xyz.eff.ref`.
- Run `dune runtest` to generate updated `dune.inc` file and `dune promote` to update it.

To create a new folder with tests:

- Create new folder somewhere under `tests`.
- Copy `dune` file from existing test folders and add empty `dune.inc` file. Fix path to `generate_dune_rules` and adjust configurations for new test generation. You can only configure expected exit code for now.
- Add test cases as above.
