# Using Eff's NoEff backend

NoEff is an intermediary language in compilation from Eff to OCaml, that has
no native effects, and is introduced for optimising the performance of compiled OCaml programs. 
A compiler backend branch that implements NoEff is included in this implementation, and follows
the theory presented [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13814).

**Limitations:** This compiler's NoEff backend excludes the following Eff features:
- polymorphism
- top-level LET and LET REC bindings

**Supported examples:** Taking into account its limitations, the following subset of examples 
in this directory is supported by the NoEff backend branch:
- `queens.eff` = a monomorphic implementation of n-queens without top-level bindings
- `loop.eff` = a recursive loop
- `dummy.eff` = a handler indirection chain
- `dummy_fun.eff` = a function indirection chain

**Usage:** The NoEff backend branch can be invoked by setting the `--explicit-subtyping`
and `--compile-plain-ocaml` options in using this compiler.
